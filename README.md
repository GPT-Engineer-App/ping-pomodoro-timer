# ping-pomodoro-timer

I want to create a pomodoro timer, with:
- a button to start a 25 minute countdown to start a pomodoro
- a button for a short break that starts a 5 minute timer (any new button click resets current timer)
- A button to pause the timer
- A button to reset the timer
- I would like a basic "ping" sound to notify my when the pomodoro or break is over
